### Sales Microservice (Port: 8090)
The Sales Microservice manages automobile sales to customers and  ensures that the dealership only sells vehicles that are not already sold, thereby maintaining inventory accuracy.

#### Key Components
- **Salesperson**: Each salesperson in the dealership is recorded with `first_name`, `last_name`, and a unique `employee_id`.
- **Customer**: This model captures details of the buyers, including their `first_name`, `last_name`, `phone_number`, and `address`.
- **Sale**: This record links a salesperson and a customer to a vehicle, detailing the sale transaction, including the price.
- **AutomobileVO (Value Object)**: This model is focused on vehicle details, uniquely identified by a `vin`. Notably, the Automobile is treated as a value object in our system, defined by its attributes.

#### Core Features
- **Unsold Only Policy**: This feature ensures that sales are only processed for vehicles that are currently unsold, ensuring reliability in inventory management.
